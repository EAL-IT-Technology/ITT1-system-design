## Deliverable

  * Details
    * PDF!
    * Must include: Summary of the day (Objectively what you did today), Achievements (related to learning golas), Evaluation (were you satisfied with yourself, classmates, teachers; could learning be better?), Links (cool links, stuff to share, links to relevant documentation, public notes)
    * Individual hand-in
* There will be group discussion, and perhaps stuff presented on the whiteboard by teacher or students.

## Comments
* I was ill on week 50, so it became less intense than intended.
* The compendium is [here](https://fronter.com/eal/links/files.phtml/1261825527$31048836$/1st+Semester/System+Design/ITT+System+design+diagrams.pdf)
* We did exercises 8.15, 8.16 and 8.17
