## Goals of the week(s)
Pratical and learning goals for the period is as follows

### Practical goals
* Recap of last week
* ENNOVA survey has been completed!

### Learning goals
* High level designs
    * level 1: The student can follow the HLD template
    * level 2: The student can make a high level design based on an existing design
    * Level 3: The student can use a L3 diagram as part of the design process to create a HLD, usable by the customer.

* Equipment, protocol and autoritative source
  * Level 1: The student know of standards and protocols
  * Level 2: The student can combine equipment with compatiable protocols
  * Level 3: The student uses the capabilities equipment and combines it with appropriate services in the design phase

## Deliverable
* A weekly hand-in about the process
  * hand-in folder on [fronter](https://fronter.com/eal/links/structureprops.phtml?treeid=275265)
  * Details
      * PDF!
      * Must include: Summary of the day (Objectively what you did today), Achievements (related to learning golas), Evaluation (were you satisfied with yourself, classmates, teachers; could learning be better?), Links (cool links, stuff to share, links to relevant documentation, public notes)
      * Individual hand-in
* There will be group discussion, and perhaps stuff presented on the whiteboard by teacher or students.
* Monday ww47, we will discuss the HLD for both the fontys project and the SOHO network.
