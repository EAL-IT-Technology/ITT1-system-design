# from data communication

In assignment 11, you are presented with a network.
Add Server01 to the subnet 192.168.6.0/24

Redraw the diagram as a pure L3 diagram.

Trouble shooting:

  * on windows, linux and junos

1. Pinging from PC1 to PC3 doesn't work
* what could be wrong?

2. Assume pinging from PC1 to PC3 now works.

3. Pinging from PC1 to PC2 doesn't work
  * what could be wrong?
  * come up with 3 test you would perform to help you find the problem

4. Assume pinging from PC1 to PC3 now works.

5. Pinging from PC3 to PC2 doesn't work.
  * what could be wrong?
  * come up with 3 test you would perform to help you find the problem

6. Assume pinging between PCs 1+3 and PCs 2+4 works

7. Pinging from PC4 to Server01 doesn't work
  * what could be wrong?
  * come up with 3 test you would perform to help you find the problem
