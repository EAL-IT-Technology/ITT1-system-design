L3 from PCAPs
====================

## background

As discussed last week, this week we wil take a package capture and turn it into a L3 diagram.

Please beware that there is always a certain level of qualified guesswork in this. 

They are uploaded to fronter on the SD room.

## Exercise 1

Download and open the `dump_wo_NFS_SSH.pcap`.

1. Create the associated L3 diagram

    Document which packages is used for you to conclude stuff
    
2. This is a package dump of something happening.
    
    * Where is the capture program running?
    * What is happening?
    * Are there more than one device active?
    
    Document which packages is used for you to conclude stuff

## Exercise 2

Download and open the `dump.pcap`.

1. Is there any difference in the toppology from Exercise 1?

2. What else is different between `dump.pcap` and `dump_wo_NFS_SSH.pcap`

Document your findings


## Exercise 3

Download and open `srvmon.pcap`

Even though this one is way smaller than the others - it is complex. It includes a lot of protocols that you probably have never heard of. So be systematic, and focus on creating the diagram.


1. Create the associated L3 diagram

    Document which packages is used for you to conclude stuff
    
2. Lots of stuff is happening here.

    * Pick 2-3 devices and figure out what they are about
    
        still documenting...
        
     * Pick 2-3 protocols and figure out what is going on.
     
        still documenting
